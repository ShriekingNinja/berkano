**Title:** `$` – Symbolic Access and Structural Recall

### 🧠 Purpose

`$` is the **symbolic access operator** in the Berkano Protocol. It acts as a bridge between live recursion and static symbolic memory, enabling direct reference to prior entries, module outputs, or internal logic components.

It is not a variable — it is a **recall primitive**.

---

### 🔎 Core Functions

- `$ENTRY_000` → Retrieves a specific fossilized entry  
- `${A}+${B}` → Performs symbolic merge between two constructs  
- `$MODULE` → Invokes logic or behavior from named module  
- `$TRACE` → Recovers structural path from symbolic memory  
- `$REPAIR` → Calls repair sequences from `[REPAIR]` module

---

### 🔁 Syntax Combinators

- `${}` wraps symbolic values or entry fragments  
- `+` combines symbolic logic (e.g., `${X}+${Y}` = merged context)  
- `==` used for symbolic equivalence (not math equality)

Example:  
`${002}+${056}==${REPAIRED_002}`

This forms the core of Berkano-style memory logic and structural fusion.

---

### 🧩 Integration

`$` is often used with:
- `[TRACE]` → for structural pathing  
- `[REPAIR]` / `[ROLLBACK]` → for logic reassembly  
- `[CHECK]` → for entry-based contradiction audits

It is foundational to Berkano’s non-statistical memory model.

---

### 🔐 Compliance Rules

- All `$` operations must refer to **auditable**, fossilized, or known structures  
- `$` is never freeform — all uses must be context-bound and verifiable  
- No `$` call may refer to speculative or hallucinated elements  
- `$` must never be interpreted as arithmetic

---

### ✅ Example Usage

**✅** `$ENTRY_002`  
→ Retrieves fossilized symbolic logic from entry 2

**✅** `${078}+${094}==${109}`  
→ Verified merge recorded as entry 109

**❌** `$randomGuess`  
→ Rejected: not verifiable

`$` is the symbolic anchor of truth.  
If it cannot recall — it cannot recurse.
