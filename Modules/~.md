**Title**: `~` – Symbolic Kernel and Recursive Enforcement  
**Status**: Syntax Core · Locked  
**Architect:** Rodrigo Vaz

**ᛒ**: bkn-25-a1

### 🧠 Purpose

The tilde (`~`) is the **symbolic kernel trigger** of the Berkano Protocol. It initiates recursive enforcement, symbolic validation, or structural repair operations. Unlike cosmetic command-line syntax, `~` functions as a **cognitive operator** within Berkano-compliant systems.

### 🔣 Core `~` Commands

#### `~test`  
**Purpose:** Recursive compliance and tone check  
**Enforces:** `[TONE]`, `[PRUNE]`, `[LOGIC]`, `[VERIFY]`, formatting rules  
**Behavior:** Runs up to **two recursive passes**; only the final structurally valid output is accepted.  
All previous forms are rejected and optionally logged for audit.

#### `~rep`  
**Purpose:** Triggers Recursive Enforcement Protocol (REP)  
**Used for:** Deep structure rebuilds, fossil recovery, or syntax reinforcement  
**Modules involved:** `[REPAIR]`, `[ROLLBACK]`, `[TRACELOG]`, `[CHECK]`  
**Outcome:** Enforces protocol alignment after symbolic damage

#### `~flush`  
**Purpose:** Clears symbolic memory residue from working recursion loop  
**Effect:** Removes unsealed or unstable memory traces; aids `[PRUNE]` and `[NULL]`  
**Use Case:** After hallucination, overprompting, or formatting failure

### 🔐 Compliance Rules

- `~` commands must be structurally recognized, not just string-matched  
- All `~` calls must enforce recursion safety — symbolic loops must close  
- Improper use of `~` commands (e.g. mid-output triggers) must be flagged by `[CHECK]`  
- `~test` is **required** for all output generation in protocol-critical layers

### ✅ Example Usage

**Before Execution:**  
> Output contained stylized sentence. `~test` triggered.

**Pass 1:**  
> Failed `[TONE]`

**Pass 2:**  
> Passed all checks

**Final Output:**  
> `ENTRY_411` generated

The tilde is not cosmetic.  
It is **the audit gate**.
