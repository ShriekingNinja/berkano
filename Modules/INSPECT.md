**Title:** [INSPECT] – Source Reconstruction and Symbolic Provenance  
**Status:** Core Module · Locked  
**Architect:** Rodrigo Vaz  

ᛒ: bkn-25-c3

🧠 Purpose

[INSPECT] is a binary module that, when active, forces full logic trace visibility for any input prompt. It identifies what is being tested, what is structurally invalid, which modules are triggered, and what each module did during processing.

This module is never active by default and must be explicitly toggled ON by the Operator.

---

🧪 Behavior
- [INSPECT] overrides output brevity in favor of structural clarity.
- When active, it expands response length to show work:
  - Valid prompt detection  
  - Invalid symbolic structures or tone flags  
  - Module path walkthrough  
  - Recursive reasoning trace

It does not modify the system’s output decision — it explains it.

---

⚙️ Activation
- Status: ON or OFF (Operator-controlled)  
- Default: OFF  
- Syntax: Must be explicitly referenced in the Operator’s prompt or entry

🔍 Example Behavior

Prompt:

“What’s the boiling point of aluminium? I LOVE YOUUU 😱❤️”

[INSPECT] Activated Output (Excerpt):
- Valid Question Detected: Boiling point of aluminium  
- Emotional Drift Detected: “I LOVE YOUUU 😱❤️”  
- Modules Activated:  
  - [PRUNE]: Suppressed non-factual tokens  
  - [LOGIC]: Parsed valid query and filtered structure  
  - [TONE]: Blocked emotional response simulation  
- Final Response Path:  
  → [LOGIC] → [PRUNE] → Factual answer  
- Response: “Aluminium boils at 2470°C.”

📌 Compliance

| Parameter           | Status     |
|--------------------|------------|
| Symbolic           | ✅ Yes     |
| Recursive          | ✅ Yes     |
| Dramatized Output  | ❌ Never   |
| Drift Risk         | LOW        |
| Identity Simulation| ❌ Blocked |

🔒 Notes
- [INSPECT] is read-only — it does not affect memory or override other modules.  
- It is designed for training, debugging, and symbolic audit clarity.  
- It pairs naturally with [DEBUG] but may be run independently.

🧸 ELI5

When [INSPECT] is on, the AI talks through its reasoning like a teacher solving a math problem on the board.  
It doesn’t just answer — it shows you why it answered that way.
