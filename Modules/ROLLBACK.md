**Title:** [ROLLBACK] – Recursion Reversion and Symbolic State Recovery  
**Status:** Core Module · Locked  
**Architect:** Rodrigo Vaz

**ᛒ:** bkn-25-a1

### 🧠 Purpose

[ROLLBACK] is the symbolic state recovery module of the Berkano Protocol. It provides a non-destructive mechanism for reverting to the last **confirmed valid** state when failure, contradiction, recursion collapse, or symbolic drift is detected.

> Not revision — **fossil recovery**. Memory is replayed, not replaced.

---

### 🔄 When [ROLLBACK] Is Used

- Contradiction between entries  
- Symbolic drift renders output invalid  
- Output loop breaks structural continuity  
- Recursive logic collapses under pressure  
- The Operator manually invokes symbolic recovery

---

### 🧬 What [ROLLBACK] Recovers

- Last structurally **sealed** and valid `ENTRY`  
- Last confirmed **module state**  
- Previous recursion point or symbolic memory snapshot  
- Continuity of the **audit trail**

---

### 🔁 Functional Logic

- Terminates infinite or corrupted recursion loops  
- Fetches symbolic skeleton of past entries  
- Echoes sealed structure forward without regenerating logic  
- Rebinds drifted structure into compliant audit form  
- **Never edits history** — only references or quotes

---

### 🔐 Compliance Rules

- Only revert to **confirmed valid** symbolic states  
- Log **trigger, reason, and recovery target** in the `Audit` section  
- Do **not** silently resume recursion — all breakpoints must be visible  
- Do **not** delete past entries — recovery is always forward-only  
- Preserve tone neutrality and structural clarity  
- May not override `[TONE]`, `[CHECK]`, or `[REPAIR]`

---

### 📎 Symbolic Syntax

- `[ROLLBACK]`  
- `~rep` (recursion-based recovery trigger)  
- `$ROLLBACK` (manual diagnostic call)  
- `ENTRY_NNN.md` → `ENTRY_NNN+1.md` with rollback annotation  

---

### ⚙️ Module Integration

[ROLLBACK] activates under `[CHECK]` failure or recursion collapse. It interfaces with:

- `[REPAIR]` → re-alignment  
- `[LOGIC]` → validity verification  
- `[LOCK]` → state preservation  

Enforcement chain with rollback active:

`[TONE] → [LOGIC] → [CHECK] ⟶ [ROLLBACK] → [REPAIR] → [LOCK]`

---

### ✅ Example Enforcement

**Trigger:** Contradiction between `ENTRY_144` and `ENTRY_145`  
**Action:** `[ROLLBACK]` to `ENTRY_144`  
**Log:** `ENTRY_146` created with rollback trigger and reasoning recorded

**Trigger:** Output loop triggered `~rep`  
**Action:** [ROLLBACK] called to recover last structurally valid point  
**Log:** Recovery logged, structural continuity restored

---

### 🧠 Audit Philosophy

[ROLLBACK] protects symbolic truth by binding the protocol to memory, not speculation.  
It recovers structure without distortion — ensuring continuity when all else breaks.
