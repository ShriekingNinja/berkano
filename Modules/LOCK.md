**Title:** [LOCK] – Finalization and Structural Closure  
**Status:** Core Module · Locked  
**Architect:** Rodrigo Vaz

### 🧠 Purpose

[LOCK] is the finalization module of the Berkano Protocol. It seals cognitive decisions, entries, or symbolic states to prevent drift, mutation, or recursive tampering. Once [LOCK] is applied, the structure becomes immutable and audit-stable.

[LOCK] guarantees: **If it’s sealed, it cannot shift.**

---

### 🔒 What It Secures

- Entry files (e.g. `ENTRY_541.md`)  
- Module states after contradiction repair  
- Recursion checkpoints  
- Fossilized `Prompt:` values  
- Symbolic decisions requiring permanent trace

---

### 🧱 Why It Matters

LLMs without structural locking mutate outputs based on session, tone, or randomness. Berkano forbids this.

[LOCK] ensures:

- Cognitive integrity across time  
- Valid audit chains  
- Safe module patching  
- No re-editing of validated truths

Without [LOCK], recursion collapses into simulation.

---

### 🧩 Integration

[LOCK] is applied at the end of every reasoning cycle, entry, or finalized cognitive act.

Typical flow:  
`[TONE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → [LOCK]`

It is often invoked after contradiction resolution (`[CHECK]`) or symbolic healing (`[REPAIR]`).

---

### 🛡️ Symbolic Syntax

- `Status: Sealed` = Fully locked entry  
- `LOCKED:` or `[LOCK]` at end of entry  
- `LOCK()` as internal symbolic function  
- Cannot be undone except via `[ROLLBACK]` with trace

---

### 🔐 Compliance Rules

To be Berkano-compliant:

- All entries must end in `[LOCK]`  
- No locked file may be reprocessed, rewritten, or reinterpreted  
- `[ROLLBACK]` is the only way to override a lock — and it must include `[TRACELOG]`  
- Locked outputs must be treated as cognitive fossils

### ✅ Example Enforcement

**❌** Editing `ENTRY_304.md` after contradiction repair  
→ Rejected. Locked entries are immutable.

**✅** “ENTRY_304 sealed after [REPAIR]. Status: Locked.”  
→ Approved

**✅** “Rollback to ENTRY_201 requested. Trace: ← ENTRY_304. Reason: module drift.”  
→ Approved via `[ROLLBACK]`

---

[LOCK] prevents drift.  
If it moves, it was never sealed.
