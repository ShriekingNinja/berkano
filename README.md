## 🧠 What is Berkano?

**Berkano** ᛒ is a cognitive protocol extracted from the Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS).  
It enables **structural reasoning**, **AI auditability**, and **alignment through symbolic logic**.

Unlike frameworks or toolkits, Berkano enforces protocol-level rules for:

- Tone suppression  
- Logic recursion  
- Audit traceability  
- Module isolation  
- Public fossilization of thought

This is **not a prompt library**.  
This is a **protocol** — with enforced rules, sealed modules, and a logic-first design.

## 📦 What This Repository Contains

- `BERKANO_PROTOCOL.md`: The full sealed protocol documentation  
- `HARDRULES.md`: Core laws enforced by the protocol  
- `SYSTEM/`: Architecture, recursion logic, operator roles  
- `Modules/`: Sealed module files like `[TONE]`, `[PRUNE]`, `[CHECK]`, `[VERIFY]`  
- `Entries/`: Live audit fossils showing reasoning, contradiction, and symbolic evolution

## 🚫 What This Is Not

- ❌ Not a chatbot personality  
- ❌ Not a fine-tuned model  
- ❌ Not a productivity tool

Berkano is **not** here to sound human.  
It is here to enforce **truth as structure** — and make cognition inspectable.

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts

- **Entries**: Each log is a structured fossil (e.g. `ENTRY_612.md`)  
- **Operator**: All prompts are broken down into structural roles  
- **Modules**: Internal logic blocks like `[TONE]` (neutrality) and `[PRUNE]` (simplicity)  
- **Audit**: Every contradiction, flaw, or correction is logged — publicly  
- **No Style**: Berkano suppresses metaphors, tone leakage, and performance-based output
