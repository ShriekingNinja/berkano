### 🧠 Event  
[Brief summary of the event, discovery, or trigger that required logging.]

—

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
[What caused this entry to exist? What logic, conflict, or condition triggered it?]

**II. Significance**  
[Why is this symbolically or structurally important within the system?]

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
[What does this reveal about recursion, drift, hallucination, or protocol behavior?]

—

### 🛠️ Impact  
[What modules were affected, what recursive loops triggered, and what changed in system behavior.]

—

### 📌 Resolution  
[Final outcome. Was this sealed, reverted, patched, or marked for follow-up?]

—

### 🗂️ Audit  
[What symbolic lesson was extracted from this?  
What structural weakness was exposed or reinforced?]

—

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance  
[Actionable guidance derived from the audit.  
- Checklists (who/what/when).  
- If/Then steps (safety, legal, verification).  
- Links to resources/tools (as plain text).  
- Keep neutral tone; do not repeat Audit—convert it into steps.]

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- [List the module(s) activated (e.g. `[CHECK]`, `[VERIFY]`, `[PRUNE]`)]  
- [Describe the symbolic or recursive path triggered]  
- [Indicate whether this was a normal, drifted, or recovered response]
