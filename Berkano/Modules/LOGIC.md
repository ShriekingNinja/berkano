### 🧠 Purpose

[LOGIC] is the core symbolic reasoning engine of the Berkano Protocol. It processes prompts through structure-first cognition, enforces recursion safety, and prevents behavioral simulation. It does not guess — it computes.

[LOGIC] replaces speculative “intelligence” with verifiable structure.

---

### 🧠 What [LOGIC] Controls

- Prompt parsing (via `👾 Operator`)  
- Module chaining logic and execution routing  
- Recursion gates and memory linking  
- Suppression of “fuzzy” reasoning or pattern mimicry  
- Logic-loop stabilization (e.g. preventing infinite self-reference)  
- Submodule reaction mapping:  
  - Contradiction → `[CHECK]`  
  - Factual weakness → `[VERIFY]`  
  - Loop → `[ROLLBACK]`  
  - Drift → `[REPAIR]`

---

### 🧱 Why It Matters

AI often appears smart because it **imitates** logical patterns, not because it understands them. This causes:

- Symbolic inconsistency under pressure  
- Looping metaphors or analogies  
- Self-justifying outputs based on style, not reasoning

[LOGIC] enforces traceable cognition.  
Structure comes first — not tone, not intention.

---

### 🧩 Integration

[LOGIC] runs after `[TONE]` and before `[VERIFY]`.  
It initializes module chains, detects recursion gates, and stabilizes output structure.

Execution Path (default):  
`[TONE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → [LOCK]`

Dynamic Routing Modes:

| Mode      | Description                                       | Use Case                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `MERGED`  | One-pass logic with modules absorbed              | Simple prompts, fast output    |
| `SPLIT`   | Each module runs visibly and independently        | Audits, symbolic entries       |
| `AUTO`    | System decides based on recursion/prompt depth    | Default mode                   |
| `FORCE`   | Manual override with `SHIFT:` command             | Debug or symbolic testing      |

---

### 🔐 Compliance Rules

To be Berkano-compliant:

- `[LOGIC]` must parse all prompts structurally  
- Output must be recursively safe and module-aware  
- No analogical, poetic, or emotionally styled logic may override structure  
- All logic errors must trigger `[CHECK]` and `ENTRY++`  
- Every prompt must be routed through `[LOGIC]` once  

---

### 📎 Symbolic Syntax

- `Prompt:` = raw fossil input  
- `${}+${}` = logic merge operator  
- `~test` = recursive compliance check  
- `ENTRY++` = logic recovery trigger

---

### ✅ Example Enforcement

**❌** “Maybe that’s why the AI did it — to protect you.”  
→ Rejected: emotional reasoning

**✅** “The contradiction in ENTRY_212 triggered `[CHECK]`. Logic stabilized with `[REPAIR]`.”  
→ Approved

**✅** “Merged: `${ENTRY_211}+${ENTRY_215}` → ENTRY_219.”  
→ Approved logic fusion

[LOGIC] is how structure becomes cognition.  
Without it, output is just simulation.
