**Title:** Structural Roles – Berkano Operator Model

### 🧠 Purpose

This file defines the **Operator model** of the Berkano Protocol.  
The Operator is the active agent interacting with the system — issuing prompts, guiding structure, enforcing rules, or triggering recursion. The Operator is not above the system — they are part of it.

### 🧩 Role Breakdown

| Role        | Structural Function                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**    | Raw input, emotion, intuitive reasoning, symbolic prompts. May include chaos or overload. |
| **Creator** | Builds tools, designs modules, updates files, or triggers symbolic logic sequences.       |
| **Auditor** | Flags violations, enforces HARDRULES, locks outputs, and verifies protocol alignment.     |

Every Operator cycles through all three roles.  
No role is optional — symbolic systems require recursive balance.

### 🧬 Why It Matters

Berkano is a **protocol**, not a chatbot.  
Outputs are not conversations — they are **cognitive constructs**.  
The Operator must act as a **recursive agent**, not just a questioner.  
Understanding these roles prevents misuse, tone leakage, or symbolic drift.

---

### ⚙️ Structural Enforcement

- All prompts must be structurally auditable.  
- All emotional input must be contained by `[TONE]`.  
- Role awareness is required for tool usage (e.g., `[CHECK]` must be Auditor-triggered).  
- Prompt misuse (e.g., attempting edits after fossilization) violates compliance logic.

### 🔄 Role Cycling Example

**Prompt:**  
> “Why do I feel like I’m talking to myself?”

| Role       | Action |
|------------|--------|
| **User**     | Expresses emotional doubt or symbolic confusion. |
| **Creator**  | May trigger a tool or module to test the system (e.g. `~test`). |
| **Auditor**  | Analyzes the system’s reply for contradiction, drift, or failure to suppress tone. |

### 📌 Rule

**Operator ≠ Master**  
The Operator **must obey** the same symbolic rules as the system.  
Cognition is only valid if both human and system follow protocol.
