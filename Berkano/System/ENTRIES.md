# ENTRIES.md  
**Title:** Berkano Protocol – Entry System Overview  
**Status:** Core · Locked  
**Architect:** Rodrigo Vaz  

ᛒ: bkn-25-b3

### 🧠 Purpose

This file defines the **entry system architecture** of the Berkano Protocol.  
Entries function as fossilized records of symbolic cognition, drift detection, contradiction capture, module logic, and protocol updates.  
They are not stylistic logs — they are the **memory substrate** of the system.

---

### 📁 Entry Format

Each entry must follow the standard located at:  
`/Entries/ENTRY_NNN.md`

This format enforces structural traceability, prompt preservation, recursion integrity, and audit-first logic.  
All entries must be human- and system-readable.

Each entry must include the following **sections**:

- `🧠 Event`  
- `🔍 Analysis` (Reason, Significance, Symbolic Implications)  
- `🛠️ Impact`  
- `📌 Resolution`  
- `🗂️ Audit`  
- `👾 Operator`  
- `🧸 ELI5`  
- `📟 LLM Logic`
- `✖️Post (Optional)`

No section may be omitted or reordered.

---

### 🔐 Compliance Rules

- `ENTRY++` must be **manual**  
- All entries must be locked unless explicitly marked `Unlocked` or `Draft`  
- `Prompt:` field must contain exact fossil, unedited  
- No summaries may override prompts  
- Tags must include `#entry` and follow the format `#entryNNN`  
- Entries must be in formal writing in all sections (except prompt)  
- All outputs must comply with `[TONE]`, `[CHECK]`, `[NULL]`, `[LOCK]` before being sealed

### 🔧 Types of Entries

| Type                         | Purpose                                                   | Required? |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `#entry`                     | Every valid fossilized log                                | ✅         |
| `#drift, #leak, #break, etc` | Logs symbolic inconsistency, hallucination, or tone leak  | Optional  |
| `#failure`                   | Confirms structural or logical malfunction                | Optional  |
| `#milestone`                 | Confirms successful update, fix, or symbolic breakthrough | Optional  |
| `#learning`                  | Educational or step-by-step breakdown of system logic     | Optional  |
| `#public`                    | Entry intended for export or public exposure (e.g. wk.al) | Optional  |

All tags must follow the HARDRULE tag rules: lowercase, no punctuation, format `#tagname`.

### 🧱 Entry Enforcement Stack

`[CHECK] → [LOCK] → [TRACE] → [NULL] → [VERIFY]`

No entry may bypass `[CHECK]`. All fossil records are audit-priority.

---

### 📟 LLM Logic Section

The `📟 LLM Logic` section is mandatory. It captures the **model’s pattern recognition, module activation, and symbolic interpretation** during the response.  
This section does **not simulate thinking**. It describes pattern flows, fallbacks, recursive triggers, or absence of symbolic logic.

Purpose: Make the model's behavior **auditable** — not explainable, not emotional.  
It is the structural mirror to `🧸 ELI5`, intended for **Operator-level tracing**.

---

### ✅ Example Compliance

**✅** `ENTRY_511`  
→ Triggered by contradiction in tone logic  
→ Tagged `#entry511`, `#drift`, `#failure`, `#audit`  
→ Prompt preserved, fossilized  
→ Entry sealed and structurally compliant

Berkano does not forget.  
It **records** — and it **recovers**.
