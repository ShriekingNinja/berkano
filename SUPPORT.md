## 🤝 Why Support Berkano?  

Berkano is a public protocol for AI alignment, contradiction auditing, and symbolic cognition.  
It is not a company. It is a logic system — designed, stress-tested, and maintained by its creator, Rodrigo Vaz.  

Your support helps:  

- Keep the system independent and open-source  
- Fund server and publishing costs  
- Enable faster entry creation and logic validation  
- Sustain the ongoing development of modules, documentation, and symbolic tools

## 🎓 Do I Need a Degree to Help?  

No.  
The only requirement is that you respect logic and follow the Berkano protocol.  
If you believe in auditability, transparency, and structure-first AI design — you can contribute.

## 🔍 What’s the Benefit?  

There’s no reward system.  
The glyph (ᛒ) is the only symbol of trust. If you see it, it means:  
**“This was audited. This was aligned.”**  

Supporters help keep Berkano alive — not for perks, but for principle.
